INSTALLATION

The script requires PHP 5.2 or newer and a MySQL database of version 5.5 or newer.

* The file forum.zip contains a folder with the script files ("forum").
* Load up the complete folder to your server.
* The file db_settings.php requires write permission! Set this with your FTP programm
  (CHMOD 666).
* Start install.php on your server (http://www.example.net/forum/install.php).
* Fill in the form completely.
* After installing, remove the file install.php from the server!
* The file db_settings.php doesn't require write permission anymore! Remove the write permission with your FTP programm
  (CHMOD 444 or 644).
* You can now log in with the name and password you specified during the installation.
  In the "admin area" you can then customize the forum.
* To customize the layout, edit the theme files (mainly "themes/[theme-name]/templates/main.html" and "themes/[theme-name]/style.css").
